### Added

#### Existing Repository Support
- **Existing Repo skill** - Analyze existing codebases, maintain structure, setup guardrails
  - Repo structure detection (monorepo, full-stack, frontend-only, backend-only)
  - Tech stack auto-detection (TypeScript, Python, Flutter, Android, etc.)
  - Convention detection (naming, imports, exports, test patterns)
  - Guardrails audit (pre-commit hooks, linting, formatting, type checking)
  - Structure preservation rules - work within existing patterns, don't reorganize
  - Gradual implementation strategy for adding guardrails to legacy projects
  - Cross-repo coordination for separate frontend/backend repos

- **`/analyze-repo` command** - Quick analysis of any existing repository
  - Directory structure mapping
  - Guardrails status audit (Husky, pre-commit, ESLint, Ruff, commitlint, etc.)

  - Generates analysis report with recommendations
  - Offers to add missing guardrails
  - **Auto-triggered** by `/initialize-project` when existing codebase detected

#### Initialize Project Enhancement
- **Auto-analysis for existing codebases** - `/initialize-project` now automatically analyzes existing repos before making changes
- **User choice after analysis** - Options: skills only, skills + guardrails, full setup, or just view analysis
- **Existing-repo skill auto-copied** - When working with existing codebases

#### Guardrails Setup (for JS/TS and Python)

## [2.0.0] - 2026-01-08

### Breaking Changes
- **Skills structure changed** - Skills now use folder/SKILL.md structure instead of flat .md files
  - Before: `~/.claude/skills/base.md`
  - After: `~/.claude/skills/base/SKILL.md`
- All skills now require YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description` fields

### Added
- **Validation test** (`tests/validate-structure.sh`) - Validates skills structure, commands, hooks
  - `--full` mode: All 142 checks
  - `--quick` mode: Essential checks for initialize-project
- **Phase 0 validation** in `/initialize-project` - Checks bootstrap installation before setup
- **Conversion script** (`scripts/convert-skills-structure.sh`) - Migrates flat skills to folder structure
- Install script now runs validation automatically
- Symlink created at `~/.claude-bootstrap` for easy access to validation tools

### Fixed
- Skills now load properly in Claude Code (fixes #1)
- Install script properly copies skill folders instead of merging contents

### Migration
```bash
cd ~/.claude-bootstrap
git pull
./install.sh
```
